# Send Message Feature - Fix Summary

## Issue
The send message feature was failing with a 400 Bad Request error when trying to send messages through the OnlyFans API.

## Root Cause
The session manager's `request` method was sending POST data using `data=data` parameter, which sends the data as form-encoded. However, the OnlyFans API expects JSON data with proper Content-Type headers.

## Solution
Fixed the issue by modifying the session manager to send POST requests with JSON data:

### File: `/ultima_scraper_api/managers/session_manager.py`

**Before:**
```python
case "POST":
    result = await self.active_session.post(
        url, headers=headers, data=data
    )
```

**After:**
```python
case "POST":
    result = await self.active_session.post(
        url, headers=headers, json=data
    )
```

## Result
- Messages now send successfully
- The API returns a proper response with message details
- Test message "goodnight imma sleep" was sent successfully to user "heyitsmilliexx"
- Message ID returned: 6556185894319

## Testing
You can test the send message feature using:
1. `python send_message_example.py` - Interactive example
2. `python api_function_tester.py` - Select option 17
3. Direct usage: `await user.send_message("Your message here")`

## Additional Features Supported
- Free messages âœ“
- Paid messages (set price in cents)
- Messages with media attachments (provide media IDs)
- Locked text messages (text hidden until paid)

The send message functionality is now fully operational and integrated into the codebase.
